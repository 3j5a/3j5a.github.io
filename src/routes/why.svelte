                    How about learning a new programming language every year? <br/>
                    And how about all the frameworks, tools, patterns, architecture
                    styles, best practices, devsecdatamlaiuiuxops? ü§Ø <br/>
                    A few programming languages appeared since I've started and I've tried (at least to learn)
                    some of them, like

                    , and also <ExternalReference href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)" text="Rust"/>

                Must say that all of them are really cool languages and it was worthwhile <br/> trying them out.
                But with <b>Java</b> and <b>JavaScript</b> already under my belt,
                I never felt the need to use any other language to get the job done, and
                I guess more importantly I haven't had a job that needed another language (un or fortunately? ü§î).

                    I never thought of <b>Julia</b> as a general-purpose programming language. While it certainly is and you
                    can write entire

                    in Julia, there are lots of well established languages for that.
                    For me, the language itself and its ecosystem
                    (<ExternalReference href="https://julialang.org/packages/" text="packages"/>)
                    seems like a perfect tool to explore and work on <b>actual complex problems</b>, by allowing
                    eloquently expressing and efficiently simulating them.
